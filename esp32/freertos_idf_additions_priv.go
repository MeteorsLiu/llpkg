 * In ESP-IDF FreeRTOS under SMP builds, spinlocks are to protect different

 * of tasks.c.
 *
 * This lock is taken whenever any of the kernel's data structures are
 * accessed/modified, such as when adding/removing tasks to/from the delayed
 * task list or various event lists.
 *
 * In more cases, kernel data structures are not accessed by functions outside
 * tasks.c. Thus, all accesses of the kernel data structures inside tasks.c will
 * handle the taking/releasing of the "xKerneLock".
 *
 * This functions is meant to be called by xEventGroupSetBits() and
 * vEventGroupDelete() as both those functions will directly access event lists
 * (which are kernel data structures). Thus, a wrapper function must be provided
 * to take/release the "xKernelLock" from outside tasks.c.
